Hello All! This is the first text content from Forcing Spike! We're two professionals (not at Magic) trying to level up/break through. I was fortunate to be able to play in several Ultimate Masters events over last weekend at PAX Unplugged and I'm eager to share what I've learned with anyone out there trying to get the most out of this limited format. I hope this information helps you all enjoy UMA as much as I have.

Its time for the God of Thunder to get a much needed rework. Hulks rework was decent and Thor needs similar. Doesnt need to meta or groundbreaking, but at least strong enough to need to pay attention while fighting against him. Maybe make his passive +20% damage and +15% Damage per Wave 1 Avenger After watching Endgame, here's what I think is Strange's plan. The first thing that sounds ridiculous to me is that there is only ONE possible win scenario out of 14 million? This clearly indicates that the iterations that Strange WANTED to see had a fundamental flaw, namely, that he and the avengers would defeat Thanos WITHOUT his giving up the time stone. But then this calls into question a major plot hole.when Thanos' henchman tried to get the time stone off Strange, he said that there. 
It seems to me that Twin Twisters discard cost is actually too expensive in the current format, since it will most likely be used to either bait Roar or destroy Mine and then get negated anyway. And is therefore better in the Side. Cosmic Cyclone is probably also not the best choice right now, since the LP cost is beneficial to the opponent, if they play a Mine deck, which will probably be a common deck going forward. Pankratops can also be a brick right now (Because of Mystic Mine). How do you see Orcusts doing with Dingrisu and Climax? How do you feel about Sorc's ban? Are you also just not going to go to events outside of locals until Mystic Mine is gone? Will Sky Strikers still be a top threat? Will Thundras finally stop coming second? How's the grind for invites been going? Let's talk about the meta, preferably without an excess of whining about it, because the meta right now is pretty fun. Except Mystic Mine lockdown, that deck is stupid. During pvp . and unless I‚Äôm tripping, I‚Äôve noticed various times for how long it takes your character to get up after being knocked down How exactly does this work? I swear I‚Äôll get knocked down and I‚Äôll spam my arrow keys for like 7 seconds before my character gets up. And THEN I‚Äôll knoc someone else down, and they‚Äôll seemingly get up instantly Are there ways to decrease My DM is going to make a new campaign that's eldritch horror themed. More social intrigue based. He told everyone to get wild characters and send him ideas. Most things are allowed. I want to make a changeling mystic. The idea was that he uses the order of the soulblade to seem harmless but is actually powerful. I want him to be part of a cartel in his backstory, protecting his interests. I know I've seen my fair share of comments shitting on mystic for being too op. But my DM likes I'm a lvl 60 ranger, with 262 AP, just came back recently. I know ranger is in a terrible state and I dont even know if it's worth doing hysteria. So if anyone can help, that would be amazing. ###LEC 2019 SPRING Official page (https://eu.lolesports.com/en/league/lec) Leaguepedia (https://lol.gamepedia.com/LEC/2019_Season/Spring_Season) Liquipedia ( Live Discussion (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/am3gmu/lec_2019_spring_week_3_day_1_live_discussion/) Eventvods.com (https://eventvods.com/featured/lol?utm_source=redditamputm_medium=subredditamputm_campaign=post_match_thre. So I took a trip to the TW server to have a look at shit we will get in the near, and far future. There were some items I couldn‚Äôt find, such as pretty much anything for BM since the English patcher didnt work for BM accessories or weapon. There were also a few new ET badges that I couldn‚Äôt find such as Ice FM and one of the Warden specs. I didn‚Äôt screenshot the Soul upgrade path as TW soul upgrade path is completely different to ours so it would not be helpful at all, same with pet, heart Hello!

After watching some content creators (Tony Bing/ Khasino) attempted at 110kish power while my team was 120k. (Thanos, loki, mordo, SW, HS) I was like ‚Äúhey, I can do that‚Äù Of course all the attempts failed, just as strange has forseen it in my endless 14 million six hundred and five tries. (Honestly I tried I need help choosing my Vocation. I started as a Fighter because I hardly ever choose to start as a Fighter, and with that in mind I decide that my final vocation would be something I hadn't really tried before. I know most of the gameplay differences when it comes to these two but I need help choosing all the same. Pick one and give your reason. Edit: Format, Math and Grammar First of all, Thank you /u/Seguren for making these. https://i.imgur.com/Z1CS15i.jpg Now, I do find some stuff in this visual guide that I disagree we as priest will need when leveling up.

I want to go Warrior, Ninja or Dark Knight. Would any of the classes I want better pair with Mystic or Tamer? And from the one I want to play is one better suited to go solo when I‚Äôm not playing with her if I make a second character? Thank you all for any quick tips and or suggestions. I‚Äôm making a new character right now and I just want some options for a solid pvp class. I played BDO about 4 years ago, got a Striker to level 50 then quit. Any suggestions appreciated, thanks.
