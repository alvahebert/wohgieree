I'm mostly into electronic music so I'm not sure how often this happens in other genres, but I see that almost every artist releases one or more singles before the entire album release. Has it always been this way? What are your thoughts on this? Why do artists do it? I don't really know whether it's a new thing or if it has always been around, but it bothers me that I already know half of the album (usually the more popular songs of it) before its release. It just spoils the whole experience. View credits, reviews, tracks and shop for the 2016 CD release of Cloud Nine on Discogs.
